    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These poems have been written under various, and, in some cases,
      difficult, conditions: in the open air, "with team afield;" in the
      student's den, with the ghosts of unfinished lessons hovering gloomily
      about; amid the rush and roar of railroad travel, which trains of thought
      are not prone to follow; and in the editor's sanctum, where the dainty
      feet of the Muses do not often deign to tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crude and unfinished as they are, the author has yet had the assurance to
      publish them, from time to time, in different periodicals, in which, it is
      but just to admit, they have been met by the people with unexpected favor.
      While his judgment has often failed to endorse the kind words spoken for
      them, he has naturally not felt it in his heart to file any remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has been asked, by friends in all parts of the country, to put his
      poems into a more durable form than they have hitherto possessed; and it
      is in accordance with these requests that he now presents "Farm Ballads"
      to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he does not expect to escape, what he needs so greatly, the
      discipline of severe criticism; for he is aware that he has often wandered
      out of the beaten track, and has many times been too regardless of the
      established rules of rhythm, in his (oftentimes vain) search for the
      flowers of poesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he believes that The People are, after all, the true critics, and will
      soon ascertain whether there are more good than poor things in a book; and
      whatever may be their verdict in this case, he has made up his mind to be
      happy.<br /> W. C.

            BETSEY AND I ARE OUT.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Draw up the papers, lawyer, and make 'em good and stout;<br /> For
            things at home are crossways, and Betsey and I are out.<br /> We, who
            have worked together so long as man and wife,<br /> Must pull in
            single harness for the rest of our nat'ral life.
          </p>
          <p>
            "What is the matter?" say you. I swan it's hard to tell!<br /> Most
            of the years behind us we've passed by very well;<br /> I have no
            other woman, she has no other man&mdash;<br /> Only we've lived
            together as long as we ever can.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I have talked with Betsey, and Betsey has talked with me,<br />
            And so we've agreed together that we can't never agree;<br /> Not
            that we've catched each other in any terrible crime;<br /> We've been
            a-gathering this for years, a little at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a stock of temper we both had for a start,<br /> Although
            we never suspected 'twould take us two apart;<br /> I had my various
            failings, bred in the flesh and bone;<br /> And Betsey, like all good
            women, had a temper of her own.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing I remember whereon we disagreed<br /> Was something
            concerning heaven&mdash;a difference in our creed;<br /> We arg'ed
            the thing at breakfast, we arg'ed the thing at tea,<br /> And the
            more we arg'ed the question the more we didn't agree.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the next that I remember was when we lost a cow;<br /> She had
            kicked the bucket for certain, the question was only&mdash;How?<br />
            I held my own opinion, and Betsey another had;<br /> And when we were
            done a-talkin', we both of us was mad.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the next that I remember, it started in a joke;<br /> But full
            for a week it lasted, and neither of us spoke.<br /> And the next was
            when I scolded because she broke a bowl;<br /> And she said I was
            mean and stingy, and hadn't any soul.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so that bowl kept pourin' dissensions in our cup;<br /> And so
            that blamed cow-critter was always a-comin' up;<br /> And so that
            heaven we arg'ed no nearer to us got,<br /> But it gave us a taste of
            somethin' a thousand times as hot.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so the thing kept workin', and all the self-same way;<br />
            Always somethin' to arg'e, and somethin' sharp to say;<br /> And down
            on us came the neighbors, a couple dozen strong,<br /> And lent their
            kindest sarvice for to help the thing along.
          </p>
          <p>
            And there has been days together&mdash;and many a weary week&mdash;<br />
            We was both of us cross and spunky, and both too proud to speak;<br />
            And I have been thinkin' and thinkin', the whole of the winter and
            fall,<br /> If I can't live kind with a woman, why, then, I won't at
            all.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so I have talked with Betsey, and Betsey has talked with me,<br />
            And we have agreed together that we can't never agree;<br /> And what
            is hers shall be hers, and what is mine shall be mine;<br /> And I'll
            put it in the agreement, and take it to her to sign.

            Write on the paper, lawyer&mdash;the very first paragraph&mdash;<br />
            Of all the farm and live-stock that she shall have her half;<br />
            For she has helped to earn it, through many a weary day,<br /> And
            it's nothing more than justice that Betsey has her pay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Give her the house and homestead&mdash;a man can thrive and roam;<br />
            But women are skeery critters, unless they have a home;<br /> And I
            have always determined, and never failed to say,<br /> That Betsey
            never should want a home if I was taken away.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a little hard money that's drawin' tol'rable pay:<br /> A
            couple of hundred dollars laid by for a rainy day;<br /> Safe in the
            hands of good men, and easy to get at;<br /> Put in another clause
            there, and give her half of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, I see you smile, Sir, at my givin' her so much;<br /> Yes,
            divorce is cheap, Sir, but I take no stock in such!<br /> True and
            fair I married her, when she was blithe and young;<br /> And Betsey
            was al'ays good to me, exceptin' with her tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once, when I was young as you, and not so smart, perhaps,<br /> For
            me she mittened a lawyer, and several other chaps;<br /> And all of
            them was flustered, and fairly taken down,<br /> And I for a time was
            counted the luckiest man in town.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once when I had a fever&mdash;I won't forget it soon&mdash;<br /> I
            was hot as a basted turkey and crazy as a loon;<br /> Never an hour
            went by me when she was out of sight&mdash;<br /> She nursed me true
            and tender, and stuck to me day and night.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if ever a house was tidy, and ever a kitchen clean,<br /> Her
            house and kitchen was tidy as any I ever seen;<br /> And I don't
            complain of Betsey, or any of her acts,<br /> Exceptin' when we've
            quarreled, and told each other facts.
          </p>
          <p>
            So draw up the paper, lawyer, and I'll go home to-night,<br /> And
            read the agreement to her, and see if it's all right;<br /> And then,
            in the mornin', I'll sell to a tradin' man I know,<br /> And kiss the
            child that was left to us, and out in the world I'll go.
          </p>
          <p>
            And one thing put in the paper, that first to me didn't occur:<br />
            That when I am dead at last she'll bring me back to her;<br /> And
            lay me under the maples I planted years ago,<br /> When she and I was
            happy before we quarreled so.
          </p>
          <p>
            And when she dies I wish that she would be laid by me,<br /> And,
            lyin' together in silence, perhaps we will agree;<br /> And, if ever
            we meet in heaven, I wouldn't think it queer<br /> If we loved each
            other the better because we quarreled here.

            No&mdash;for I was laborin' under a heavy load;<br /> No&mdash;for I
            was travelin' an entirely different road;<br /> For I was a-tracin'
            over the path of our lives ag'in,<br /> And seein' where we missed
            the way, and where we might have been.

            'tain't an uncommon thing now for couples to smash in two;"<br /> And

          <p>
            I'VE worked in the field all day, a-plowin' the "stony streak;"<br />
            I've scolded my team till I'm hoarse; I've tramped till my legs are

            When the plow-p'int struck a stone and the handles punched my ribs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've put my team in the barn, and rubbed their sweaty coats;<br />
            I've fed 'em a heap of hay and half a bushel of oats;<br /> And to
            see the way they eat makes me like eatin' feel,<br /> And Jane won't

          <p>
            Well said! the door is locked! but here she's left the key,<br />

            who's dyin' or dead, that she's hustled off pell-mell:<br /> But here
            on the table's a note, and probably this will tell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Good God! my wife is gone! my wife is gone astray!<br /> The letter
            it says, "Good-bye, for I'm a-going away;<br /> I've lived with you
            six months, John, and so far I've been true;<br /> But I'm going away
            to-day with a handsomer man than you."
          </p>
          <p>
            A han'somer man than me! Why, that ain't much to say;<br /> There's
            han'somer men than me go past here every day.<br /> There's han'somer
            men than me&mdash;I ain't of the han'some kind;<br /> But a lovin'er
            man than I was I guess she'll never find.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curse her! curse her! I say, and give my curses wings!<br /> May the
            words of love I've spoke be changed to scorpion stings!<br /> Oh, she
            filled my heart with joy, she emptied my heart of doubt,<br /> And
            now, with a scratch of a pen, she lets my heart's blood out!

          <p>
            I'll take my hard words back, nor make a bad matter worse;<br />

            'Twas only this mornin' she came and called me her "dearest dear,"<br />

            Tall and big and handsome, and new as new can be;<br /> All in

          <p>
            Probably you remember how rich we was that night,<br /> When we was

            Never a handsomer house was seen beneath the sun:<br /> Kitchen and
            parlor and bedroom&mdash;we had 'em all in one;<br /> And the fat old
            wooden clock that we bought when we come West,<br /> Was tickin' away
            in the corner there, and doin' its level best.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trees was all around us, a-whisperin' cheering words;<br /> Loud was
            the squirrel's chatter, and sweet the songs of birds;<br /> And home
            grew sweeter and brighter&mdash;our courage began to mount&mdash;<br />
            And things looked hearty and happy then, and work appeared to count.
          </p>
          <p>
            And here one night it happened, when things was goin' bad,<br /> We
            fell in a deep old quarrel&mdash;the first we ever had;<br /> And
            when you give out and cried, then I, like a fool, give in,<br /> And
            then we agreed to rub all out, and start the thing ag'in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here it was, you remember, we sat when the day was done,<br /> And
            you was a-makin' clothing that wasn't for either one;<br /> And often
            a soft word of love I was soft enough to say,<br /> And the wolves
            was howlin' in the woods not twenty rods away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then our first-born baby&mdash;a regular little joy,<br /> Though I
            fretted a little because it wasn't a boy:<br /> Wa'n't she a little

            livin', an' pay my honest way;<br /> For I can earn my victuals, an'
            more too, I'll be bound,<br /> If any body only is willin' to have me
            round.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I was young an' han'some&mdash;I was, upon my soul&mdash;<br />
            Once my cheeks was roses, my eyes as black as coal;<br /> And I can't
            remember, in them days, of hearin' people say,<br /> For any kind of
            a reason, that I was in their way.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Tain't no use of boastin', or talkin' over free,<br /> But many a
            house an' home was open then to me;<br /> Many a han'some offer I had
            from likely men,<br /> And nobody ever hinted that I was a burden
            then.
          </p>
          <p>
            And when to John I was married, sure he was good and smart,<br /> But
            he and all the neighbors would own I done my part;<br /> For life was
            all before me, an' I was young an' strong,<br /> And I worked the
            best that I could in tryin' to get along.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so we worked together: and life was hard, but gay,<br /> With now
            and then a baby for to cheer us on our way;<br /> Till we had half a
            dozen, an' all growed clean an' neat,<br /> An' went to school like
            others, an' had enough to eat.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we worked for the child'rn, and raised 'em every one;<br /> Worked
            for 'em summer and winter, just as we ought to 've done;<br /> Only
            perhaps we humored 'em, which some good folks condemn,<br /> But
            every couple's child'rn's a heap the best to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strange how much we think of our blessed little ones!&mdash;<br />
            I'd have died for my daughters, I'd have died for my sons;<br /> And
            God he made that rule of love; but when we're old and gray,<br />
            I've noticed it sometimes somehow fails to work the other way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strange, another thing: when our boys an' girls was grown,<br /> And
            when, exceptin' Charley, they'd left us there alone;<br /> When John
            he nearer an' nearer come, an' dearer seemed to be,<br /> The Lord of
            Hosts he come one day an' took him away from me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still I was bound to struggle, an' never to cringe or fall&mdash;<br />
            Still I worked for Charley, for Charley was now my all;<br /> And
            Charley was pretty good to me, with scarce a word or frown,<br />
            Till at last he went a-courtin', and brought a wife from town.

            She was somewhat dressy, an' hadn't a pleasant smile&mdash;<br /> She
            was quite conceity, and carried a heap o' style;<br /> But if ever I
            tried to be friends, I did with her, I know;<br /> But she was hard
            and proud, an' I couldn't make it go.
          </p>
          <p>
            She had an edication, an' that was good for her;<br /> But when she
            twitted me on mine, 'twas carryin' things too far;<br /> An' I told
            her once, 'fore company (an' it almost made her sick),<br /> That I
            never swallowed a grammar, or 'et a 'rithmetic.
          </p>
          <p>
            So 'twas only a few days before the thing was done&mdash;<br /> They
            was a family of themselves, and I another one;<br /> And a very
            little cottage one family will do,<br /> But I never have seen a
            house that was big enough for two.
          </p>
          <p>
            An' I never could speak to suit her, never could please her eye,<br />
            An' it made me independent, an' then I didn't try;<br /> But I was
            terribly staggered, an' felt it like a blow,<br /> When Charley
            turned ag'in me, an' told me I could go.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went to live with Susan, but Susan's house was small,<br /> And she
            was always a-hintin' how snug it was for us all;<br /> And what with
            her husband's sisters, and what with child'rn three,<br /> 'Twas easy
            to discover that there wasn't room for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            An' then I went to Thomas, the oldest son I've got,<br /> For
            Thomas's buildings 'd cover the half of an acre lot;<br /> But all
            the child'rn was on me&mdash;I couldn't stand their sauce&mdash;<br />
            And Thomas said I needn't think I was comin' there to boss.
          </p>
          <p>
            An' then I wrote to Rebecca, my girl who lives out West,<br /> And to
            Isaac, not far from her&mdash;some twenty miles at best;<br /> And
            one of 'em said 'twas too warm there for any one so old,<br /> And
            t'other had an opinion the climate was too cold.
          </p>
          <p>
            So they have shirked and slighted me, an' shifted me about&mdash;<br />
            So they have well-nigh soured me, an' wore my old heart out;<br />
            But still I've borne up pretty well, an' wasn't much put down,<br />
            Till Charley went to the poor-master, an' put me on the town.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the hill to the poor-house&mdash;my child'rn dear, good-by!<br />
            Many a night I've watched you when only God was nigh;<br /> And God
            'll judge between us; but I will al'ays pray<br /> That you shall
            never suffer the half I do to-day.

            Nothin' she wouldn't sacrifice<br /> For one she loved; an' that 'ere

          <p>
            An' all o' our folks ranked well, you see,<br /> Save one poor
            fellow, and that was me;<br /> An' when, one dark an' rainy night,<br />
            A neighbor's horse went out o' sight,<br /> They hitched on me, as
            the guilty chap<br /> That carried one end o' the halter-strap.<br />
            An' I think, myself, that view of the case<br /> Wasn't altogether
            out o' place;<br /> My mother denied it, as mothers do,<br /> But I am
            inclined to believe 'twas true.<br /> Though for me one thing might
            be said&mdash;<br /> That I, as well as the horse, was led;<br /> And
            the worst of whisky spurred me on,<br /> Or else the deed would have
            never been done.<br /> But the keenest grief I ever felt<br /> Was
            when my mother beside me knelt,<br /> An' cried an' prayed, till I
            melted down,<br /> As I wouldn't for half the horses in town.<br /> I
            kissed her fondly, then an' there,<br /> An' swore henceforth to be
            honest and square.
          </p>
          <p>
            I served my sentence&mdash;a bitter pill<br /> Some fellows should
            take who never will;<br /> And then I decided to go "out West,"<br />
            Concludin' 'twould suit my health the best;<br /> Where, how I
            prospered, I never could tell,<br /> But Fortune seemed to like we
            [me] well,<br /> An' somehow every vein I struck<br /> Was always
            bubblin' over with luck.<br /> An', better than that, I was steady
            an' true,<br /> An' put my good resolutions through.<br /> But I wrote
            to a trusty old neighbor, an' said,<br /> "You tell 'em, old fellow,
            that I am dead,<br /> An' died a Christian; 'twill please 'em more,<br />
            Than if I had lived the same as before."
          </p>
          <p>
            But when this neighbor he wrote to me,<br /> "Your mother's in the
            poor-house," says he,<br /> I had a resurrection straightway,<br />
            An' started for her that very day.<br /> And when I arrived where I
            was grown,<br /> I took good care that I shouldn't be known;<br /> But
            I bought the old cottage, through and through,<br /> Of some one
            Charley had sold it to;<br /> And held back neither work nor gold,<br />
            To fix it up as it was of old.<br /> The same big fire-place wide an'
            high,<br /> Flung up its cinders toward the sky;<br /> The old clock
            ticked on the corner-shelf&mdash;<br /> I wound it an' set it agoin'
            myself;<br /> An' if every thing wasn't just the same,<br /> Neither I
            nor money was to blame;<br /> Then&mdash;<i>over the hill to the

          </p>
          <p>
            One blowin', blusterin' winter's day,<br /> With a team an' cutter I
            started away;<br /> My fiery nags was as black as coal;<br /> (They
            some'at resembled the horse I stole);<br /> I hitched, an' entered
            the poor-house door&mdash;<br /> A poor old woman was scrubbin' the
            floor;<br /> She rose to her feet in great surprise,<br /> And looked,
            quite startled, into my eyes;<br /> I saw the whole of her trouble's
            trace<br /> In the lines that marred her dear old face;<br />
            "Mother!" I shouted, "your sorrows is done!<br /> You're adopted
            along o' your horse-thief son,<br /> Come <i>over the hill from the
            poor-house!"</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            She didn't faint; she knelt by my side,<br /> An' thanked the Lord,
            till I fairly cried.<br /> An' maybe our ride wasn't pleasant an'
            gay,<br /> An' maybe she wasn't wrapped up that day;<br /> An' maybe
            our cottage wasn't warm an' bright,<br /> An' maybe it wasn't a
            pleasant sight,<br /> To see her a-gettin' the evenin's tea,<br /> An'
            frequently stoppin' and kissin' me;<br /> An' maybe we didn't live
            happy for years,<br /> In spite of my brothers' and sisters' sneers,<br />
            Who often said, as I have heard,<br /> That they wouldn't own a
            prison-bird;<br /> (Though they're gettin' over that, I guess,<br />
            For all of 'em owe me more or less);
          </p>

            Gets over a fellow's name or not,<br /> Whenever he does a deed
            that's white,<br /> It's credited to him fair and right.<br /> An'
            when you hear the great bugle's notes,<br /> An' the Lord divides his
            sheep an' goats;<br /> However they may settle my case,<br /> Wherever
            they may fix my place,<br /> My good old Christian mother, you'll
            see,<br /> Will be sure to stand right up for me,<br /> With <i>over

            UNCLE SAMMY.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Some men were born for great things,<br /> Some were born for small;<br />
            Some&mdash;it is not recorded<br /> Why they were born at all;<br />
            But Uncle Sammy was certain he had a legitimate call.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some were born with a talent,<br /> Some with scrip and land;<br />
            Some with a spoon of silver,<br /> And some with a different brand;<br />
            But Uncle Sammy came holding an argument in each hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arguments sprouted within him,<br /> And twinked in his little eye;<br />
            He lay and calmly debated<br /> When average babies cry,<br /> And
            seemed to be pondering gravely whether to live or to die.
          </p>
          <p>
            But prejudiced on that question<br /> He grew from day to day,<br />
            And finally he concluded<br /> 'Twas better for him to stay;<br /> And
            so into life's discussion he reasoned and reasoned his way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through childhood, through youth, into manhood<br /> Argued and
            argued he;<br /> And he married a simple maiden,<br /> Though scarcely
            in love was she;<br /> But he reasoned the matter so clearly she
            hardly could help but agree.
          </p>
          <p>
            And though at first she was blooming,<br /> And the new firm started
            strong,<br /> And though Uncle Sammy loved her,<br /> And tried to
            help her along,<br /> She faded away in silence, and 'twas evident
            something was wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now Uncle Sammy was faithful,<br /> And various remedies tried;<br />
            He gave her the doctor's prescriptions,<br /> And plenty of logic
            beside;<br /> But logic and medicine failed him, and so one day she
            died.
          </p>
          <p>
            He laid her away in the church-yard,<br /> So haggard and crushed and
            wan;<br /> And reared her a costly tombstone<br /> With all of her
            virtues on;<br /> And ought to have added, "A victim to arguments pro
            and con."
          </p>
          <p>
            For many a year Uncle Sammy<br /> Fired away at his logical forte:<br />
            Discussion was his occupation,<br /> And altercation his sport;<br />
            He argued himself out of churches, he argued himself into court.
          </p>
          <p>
            But alas for his peace and quiet,<br /> One day, when he went it
            blind,<br /> And followed his singular fancy,<br /> And slighted his
            logical mind,<br /> And married a ponderous widow that wasn't of the
            arguing kind!
          </p>
          <p>
            Her sentiments all were settled,<br /> Her habits were planted and
            grown,<br /> Her heart was a starved little creature<br /> That
            followed a will of her own;<br /> And she raised a high hand with
            Sammy, and proceeded to play it alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then Sammy he charged down upon her<br /> With all of his strength
            and his wit,<br /> And many a dextrous encounter,<br /> And many a
            fair shoulder-hit;<br /> But vain were his blows and his blowing: he
            never could budge her a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            He laid down his premises round her,<br /> He scraped at her with his
            saws;<br /> He rained great facts upon her,<br /> And read her the
            marriage laws;<br /> But the harder he tried to convince her, the
            harder and harder she was.
          </p>
          <p>
            She brought home all her preachers,<br /> As many as ever she could&mdash;<br />
            With sentiments terribly settled,<br /> And appetites horribly good&mdash;<br />
            Who sat with him long at his table, and explained to him where he
            stood.

            And Sammy was not long in learning<br /> To follow the swing of her
            gown,<br /> And came to be faithful in watching<br /> The phase of her
            smile and her frown;<br /> And she, with the heel of assertion, soon
            tramped all his arguments down.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so, with his life-aspirations<br /> Thus suddenly brought to a
            check&mdash;<br /> And so, with the foot of his victor<br />
            Unceasingly pressing his neck&mdash;<br /> He wrote on his face, "I'm
            a victim," and drifted&mdash;a logical wreck.
          </p>
          <p>
            And farmers, whom he had argued<br /> To corners tight and fast,<br />
            Would wink at each other and chuckle,<br /> And grin at him as he
            passed,<br /> As to say, "My ambitious old fellow, your whiffletree's

            And the fact that SHE failed to start him was only because he was

            And laying the pipes down slyly for an argument on the way.

            And one new-fashioned old lady<br /> Felt called upon to suggest<br />
            That the angel might take Uncle Sammy,<br /> And give him a good
            night's rest,<br /> And then introduce him to Solomon, and tell him
            to do his best.

            TOM WAS GOIN' FOR A POET.
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Farmer Discourses of his Son.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom was goin' for a poet, an' said he'd a poet be;<br /> One of these
            long-haired fellers a feller hates to see;<br /> One of these chaps
            forever fixin' things cute and clever;<br /> Makin' the world in
            gen'ral step 'long to tune an' time,<br /> An' cuttin' the earth into
            slices an' saltin' it down into rhyme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poets are good for somethin', so long as they stand at the head:<br />
            But poetry's worth whatever it fetches in butter an' bread.<br /> An'
            many a time I've said it: it don't do a fellow credit,<br /> To
            starve with a hole in his elbow, an' be considered a fool,<br /> So
            after he's dead, the young ones 'll speak his pieces in school.
          </p>
          <p>
            An' Tom, he had an opinion that Shakspeare an' all the rest,<br />
            With all their winter clothin', couldn't make him a decent vest;<br />
            But that didn't ease my labors, or help him among the neighbors,<br />
            Who watched him from a distance, an' held his mind in doubt,<br />
            An' wondered if Tom wasn't shaky, or knew what he was about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom he went a-sowin', to sow a field of grain;<br /> But half of that
            'ere sowin' was altogether in vain.<br /> For he was al'ays
            a-stoppin', and gems of poetry droppin';<br /> And metaphors, they be
            pleasant, but much too thin to eat;<br /> And germs of thought be
            handy, but never grow up to wheat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom he went a-mowin', one broilin' summer's day,<br /> An' spoke
            quite sweet concernin' the smell of the new-mowed hay.<br /> But all
            o' his useless chatter didn't go to help the matter,<br /> Or make
            the grief less searchin' or the pain less hard to feel,<br /> When he
            made a clip too suddent, an' sliced his brother's heel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom he went a-drivin' the hills an' dales across;<br /> But, scannin'
            the lines of his poetry, he dropped the lines of his hoss.<br /> The
            nag ran fleet and fleeter, in quite irregular metre;<br /> An' when
            we got Tom's leg set, an' had fixed him so he could speak,<br /> He
            muttered that that adventur' would keep him a-writin' a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom he went a-ploughin', and couldn't have done it worse;<br /> He
            sat down on the handles, an' went to spinnin' verse.<br /> He wrote
            it nice and pretty&mdash;an agricultural ditty;<br /> But all o' his
            pesky measures didn't measure an acre more,<br /> Nor his p'ints
            didn't turn a furrow that wasn't turned before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom he went a-courtin';&mdash;she liked him, I suppose;<br /> But
            certain parts of courtin' a feller must do in prose.<br /> He rhymed
            her each day a letter, but that didn't serve to get her;<br /> He
            waited so long, she married another man from spite,<br /> An' sent
            him word she'd done it, an' not to forget to write.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom at last got married; his wife was smart and stout,<br /> An' she
            shoved up the window and slung his poetry out.<br /> An' at each new
            poem's creation she gave it circulation;<br /> An' fast as he would
            write 'em, she seen to their puttin' forth,<br /> An' sent 'em east
            an westward, an' also south an' north.
          </p>
          <p>
            Till Tom he struck the opinion that poetry didn't pay,<br /> An'
            turned the guns of his genius, an' fired 'em another way.<br /> He
            settled himself down steady, an' is quite well off already;<br /> An'
            all of his life is verses, with his wife the first an' best,<br />
            An' ten or a dozen childr'n to constitute the rest.

            My business on the jury's done&mdash;the quibblin' all is through&mdash;<br />
            I've watched the lawyers right and left, and give my verdict true;<br />
            I stuck so long unto my chair, I thought I would grow in;<br /> And
            if I do not know myself, they'll get me there ag'in;<br /> But now
            the court's adjourned for good, and I have got my pay;<br /> I'm
            loose at last, and thank the Lord, I'm going home to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've somehow felt uneasy like, since first day I come down;<br /> It
            is an awkward game to play the gentleman in town;<br /> And this 'ere
            Sunday suit of mine on Sunday rightly sets;<br /> But when I wear the
            stuff a week, it somehow galls and frets.<br /> I'd rather wear my
            homespun rig of pepper-salt and gray&mdash;<br /> I'll have it on in
            half a jiff, when I get home to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have no doubt my wife looked out, as well as any one&mdash;<br />
            As well as any woman could&mdash;to see that things was done:<br />
            For though Melinda, when I'm there, won't set her foot outdoors,<br />
            She's very careful, when I'm gone, to tend to all the chores.<br />
            But nothing prospers half so well when I go off to stay,<br /> And I
            will put things into shape, when I get home to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mornin' that I come away, we had a little bout;<br /> I coolly
            took my hat and left, before the show was out.<br /> For what I said
            was naught whereat she ought to take offense;<br /> And she was
            always quick at words and ready to commence.<br /> But then she's
            first one to give up when she has had her say;<br /> And she will
            meet me with a kiss, when I go home to-day.

            they laugh, because I think the child resembles me.<br /> The little

            My wife, she says that han'some face will some day make a stir;<br />
            And then I laugh, because she thinks the child resembles her.<br />
            She'll meet me half-way down the hill, and kiss me, any way;<br />

            OUT O' THE FIRE.
          </h2>
          <p>
            [As Told in 1880.]
          </p>
          <p>
            Year of '71, children, middle of the fall,<br /> On one fearful
            night, children, we well-nigh lost our all.<br /> True, it wa'n't no
            great sum we had to lose that night,<br /> But when a little's all
            you've got, it comes to a blessed sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a mighty worker, in them 'ere difficult days,<br /> For work is
            a good investment, and almost always pays;<br /> But when ten years'
            hard labor went smokin' into the air.<br /> I doubted all o' the
            maxims, an' felt that it wasn't fair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Up from the East we had traveled, with all of our household wares,<br />
            Where we had long been workin' a piece of land on shares;<br /> But
            how a fellow's to prosper without the rise of the land,<br /> For
            just two-thirds of nothin', I never could understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Up from the East we had traveled, me and my folks alone,<br /> And
            quick we went to workin' a piece of land of our own;<br /> Small was
            our backwoods quarters, and things looked mighty cheap;<br /> But
            every thing we put in there, we put in there to keep.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, with workin' and savin', we managed to get along;<br /> Managed
            to make a livin', and feel consid'able strong;<br /> And things went
            smooth and happy, an' fair as the average run,<br /> Till every thing
            went back on me, in the fall of '71.
          </p>
          <p>
            First thing bothered and worried me, was 'long o' my daughter Kate;<br />
            Rather a han'some cre'tur', and folks all liked her gait.<br /> Not
            so nice as them sham ones in yeller-covered books;<br /> But still
            there wa'n't much discount on Katherine's ways an' looks.
          </p>
          <p>
            And Katherine's smile was pleasant, and Katherine's temper good,<br />
            And how she come to like Tom Smith, I never understood;<br /> For she
            was a mornin'-glory, as fair as you ever see,<br /> And Tom was a
            shag-bark hickory, as green as green could be.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Like takes to like," is a proverb that's nothin' more than trash;<br />
            And many a time I've seen it all pulverized to smash.<br /> For folks
            in no way sim'lar, I've noticed ag'in and ag'in,<br /> Will often
            take to each other, and stick together like sin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next thing bothered and worried me, was 'long of a terrible drouth;<br />
            And me an' all o' my neighbors was some'at down in the mouth.<br />
            And week after week the rain held off, and things all pined an'
            dried,<br /> And we drove the cattle miles to drink, and many of 'em
            died.
          </p>
          <p>
            And day after day went by us, so han'some and so bright,<br /> And
            never a drop of water came near us, day or night;<br /> And what with
            the neighbors' grumblin', and what with my daily loss,<br /> I must
            own that somehow or other I was gettin' mighty cross.
          </p>
          <p>
            And on one Sunday evenin' I was comin' down the lane<br /> From
            meetin', where our preacher had stuck and hung for rain,<br /> And
            various slants on heaven kept workin' in my mind,<br /> And the smoke
            from Sanders' fallow was makin' me almost blind;
          </p>
          <p>
            I opened the door kind o' sudden, an' there my Katherine sat,<br />
            As cozy as any kitten along with a friendly cat;<br /> An' Tom was
            dreadful near her&mdash;his arm on the back of her chair&mdash;<br />
            And lookin' as happy and cheerful as if there was rain to spare.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Get out of this house in a minute!" I cried, with all my might:<br />
            "Get out, while I'm a-talkin'!"&mdash;Tom's eyes showed a bit of
            fight;<br /> But he rose up, stiff and surly, and made me a civil
            bow,<br /> And mogged along to the door-way, with never a word of
            row.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I snapped up my wife quite surly when she asked me what I'd
            said,<br /> And I scolded Kate for cryin', and sent her up stairs to
            bed;<br /> And then I laid down, for the purpose of gettin' a little
            sleep,<br /> An' the wind outside was a-howlin', and puttin' it in to
            keep.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Twas half-past three next mornin', or maybe 'twas nearer four&mdash;<br />
            The neighbors they came a-yellin' and poundin' at my door;<br /> "Get
            up! get up!" they shouted: "get up! there's danger near!<br /> The
            woods are all a-burnin'! the wind is blowin' it here!"
          </p>
          <p>
            If ever it happens, children, that you get catched, some time,<br />
            With fire a-blowin' toward you, as fast as fire can climb,<br />
            You'll get up and get in a hurry, as fast as you can budge;<br />
            It's a lively season of the year, or else I ain't no judge!
          </p>
          <p>
            Out o' the dear old cabin we tumbled fast as we could&mdash;<br />
            Smashed two-thirds of our dishes, and saved some four-foot wood;<br />
            With smoke a-settlin' round us and gettin' into our eyes,<br /> And
            fire a-roarin' an' roarin' an' drowndin' all of our cries.
          </p>
          <p>
            And just as the roof was smokin', and we hadn't long to wait,<br /> I
            says to my wife, "Now get out, and hustle, you and Kate!"<br /> And
            just as the roof was fallin', my wife she come to me,<br /> With a
            face as white as a corpse's face, and "Where is Kate?" says she.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the neighbors come runnin' to me, with faces black as the
            ground,<br /> And shouted, "Where is Katherine? She's nowhere to be
            found!"
          </p>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            An' this is all I remember, till I found myself next day,<br />
            A-lyin' in Sanders' cabin, a mile an' a half away.
          </p>
          <p>
            If ever you wake up, children, with somethin' into your head,<br />
            Concernin' a han'some daughter, that's lyin' still an' dead,<br />
            All scorched into coal-black cinders&mdash;<i>perhaps</i> you may
            not weep,<br /> But I rather think it'll happen you'll wish you'd
            a-kept asleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            And all I could say, was "Kath'rine, oh Kath'rine, come to me!"<br />
            And all I could think, was "Kath'rine!" and all that I could see,<br />
            Was Sanders a-standin' near to me, his finger into his eye,<br /> And
            my wife a-bendin' over me, and tellin' me not to cry;
          </p>
          <p>
            When, lo! Tom Smith he entered&mdash;his face lit up with grins<br />
            And Kate a-hangin' on his arm, as neat as a row of pins!<br /> And
            Tom looked glad, but sheepish; and said, "Excuse me, Squire,<br />
            But I 'loped with Kate, and married her an hour before the fire."
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, children, I was shattered; 'twas more than I could bear&mdash;<br />
            And I up and went for Kate an' Tom, and hugged 'em then and there!<br />
            And since that time, the times have changed, an' now they ain't so
            bad;<br /> And&mdash;Katherine, she's your mother now, and&mdash;Thomas
            Smith's your dad.

            THE NEW CHURCH ORGAN.
          </h2>
          <p>
            They 've got a brand-new organ, Sue,<br /> For all their fuss and
            search;<br /> They've done just as they said they'd do,<br /> And
            fetched it into church.<br /> They're bound the critter shall be
            seen,<br /> And on the preacher's right<br /> They've hoisted up their
            new machine,<br /> In every body's sight.<br /> They've got a
            chorister and choir,<br /> Ag'in' my voice and vote;<br /> For it was
            never my desire,<br /> To praise the Lord by note!
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been a sister good an' true<br /> For five-an'-thirty year;<br />
            I've done what seemed my part to do,<br /> An' prayed my duty clear;<br />
            I've sung the hymns both slow and quick,<br /> Just as the preacher
            read,<br /> And twice, when Deacon Tubbs was sick,<br /> I took the
            fork an' led!<br /> And now, their bold, new-fangled ways<br /> Is
            comin' all about;<br /> And I, right in my latter days,<br /> Am
            fairly crowded out!
          </p>
          <p>
            To-day the preacher, good old dear,<br /> With tears all in his eyes,<br />
            Read, "I can read my title clear<br /> To mansions in the skies."<br />
            I al'ays liked that blessed hymn&mdash;<br /> I s'pose I al'ays will;<br />
            It somehow gratifies my whim,<br /> In good old Ortonville;<br /> But
            when that choir got up to sing,<br /> I couldn't catch a word;<br />
            They sung the most dog-gondest thing<br /> A body ever heard!
          </p>
          <p>
            Some worldly chaps was standin' near;<br /> An' when I see them grin,<br />
            I bid farewell to every fear,<br /> And boldly waded in.<br /> I
            thought I'd chase their tune along,<br /> An' tried with all my
            might;<br /> But though my voice is good an' strong,<br /> I couldn't
            steer it right;<br /> When they was high, then I was low,<br /> An'
            also contrawise;<br /> An' I too fast, or they too slow,<br /> To
            "mansions in the skies."
          </p>
          <p>
            An' after every verse, you know,<br /> They play a little tune;<br />
            I didn't understand, an' so<br /> I started in too soon.<br /> I
            pitched it pretty middlin' high,<br /> I fetched a lusty tone,<br />
            But oh, alas! I found that I<br /> Was singin' there alone!<br /> They
            laughed a little, I am told;<br /> But I had done my best;<br /> And
            not a wave of trouble rolled<br /> Across my peaceful breast.
          </p>
          <p>
            And Sister Brown&mdash;I could but look&mdash;<br /> She sits right
            front of me;<br /> She never was no singin'-book,<br /> An' never went
            to be;<br /> But then she al'ays tried to do<br /> The best she could,
            she said;<br /> She understood the time right through,<br /> An' kep'
            it with her head;<br /> But when she tried this mornin', oh,<br /> I
            had to laugh, or cough!<br /> It kep' her head a-bobbin' so,<br /> It
            e'en a'most came off!
          </p>
          <p>
            An' Deacon Tubbs&mdash;he all broke down,<br /> As one might well
            suppose;<br /> He took one look at Sister Brown,<br /> And meekly
            scratched his nose.<br /> He looked his hymn-book through and
            through,<br /> And laid it on the seat,<br /> And then a pensive sigh
            he drew,<br /> And looked completely beat.<br /> An' when they took
            another bout,<br /> He didn't even rise;<br /> But drawed his red
            bandanner out,<br /> An' wiped his weepin' eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been a sister, good an' true,<br /> For five-an'-thirty year;<br />
            I've done what seemed my part to do,<br /> An' prayed my duty clear;<br />
            But Death will stop my voice, I know,<br /> For he is on my track;<br />
            And some day I to church will go,<br /> And never more come back;<br />
            And when the folks gets up to sing&mdash;<br /> Whene'er that time
            shall be&mdash;<br /> I do not want no <i>patent</i> thing<br />
            A-squealin' over me!

            THE EDITOR'S GUESTS.
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Editor sat in his sanctum, his countenance furrowed with care,<br />
            His mind at the bottom of business, his feet at the top of a chair,<br />
            His chair-arm an elbow supporting, his right hand upholding his
            head,<br /> His eyes on his dusty old table, with different documents
            spread:<br /> There were thirty long pages from Howler, with
            underlined capitals<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;topped,<br />
            And a short disquisition from Growler, requesting his newspaper
            stopped;<br /> There were lyrics from Gusher, the poet, concerning
            sweet flow'rets and<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zephyrs,<br />
            And a stray gem from Plodder, the farmer, describing a couple of
            heifers;<br /> There were billets from beautiful maidens, and bills
            from a grocer or two,<br /> And his best leader hitched to a letter,
            which inquired if he wrote it,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or
            who?<br /> There were raptures of praises from writers of the weakly
            mellifluous<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school,<br /> And one
            of his rival's last papers, informing him he was a fool;<br /> There
            were several long resolutions, with names telling whom they were by,<br />
            Canonizing some harmless old brother who had done nothing worse than
            to<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die;<br /> There were traps on
            that table to catch him, and serpents to sting and to<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smite
            him;<br /> There were gift enterprises to sell him, and bitters
            attempting to bite<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him;<br />
            There were long staring "ads" from the city, and money with never a
            one,<br /> Which added, "Please give this insertion, and send in your
            bill when<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you're <i>done</i>;"<br />
            There were letters from organizations&mdash;their meetings, their
            wants, and<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their laws&mdash;<br />
            Which said, "Can you print this announcement for the good of our
            glorious<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause?"<br /> There were
            tickets inviting his presence to festivals, parties, and shows,<br />
            Wrapped in notes with "Please give us a notice" demurely slipped in
            at the<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;close;<br /> In short, as
            his eye took the table, and ran o'er its ink-spattered trash,<br />
            There was nothing it did not encounter, excepting perhaps it was
            cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Editor dreamily pondered on several ponderous things.<br /> On
            different lines of action, and the pulling of different strings;<br />
            Upon some equivocal doings, and some unequivocal duns;<br /> On how
            few of his numerous patrons were quietly prompt-paying ones;<br /> On
            friends who subscribed "just to help him," and wordy encouragement<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lent,<br /> And had given him plenty of
            counsel, but never had paid him a cent;<br /> On vinegar,
            kind-hearted people were feeding him every hour,<br /> Who saw not
            the work they were doing, but wondered that "printers are<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sour:"<br /> On several intelligent
            townsmen, whose kindness was so without stint<br /> That they kept an
            eye out on his business, and told him just what he<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should
            print;<br /> On men who had rendered him favors, and never pushed
            forward their claims,<br /> So long as the paper was crowded with
            "locals" containing their names;<br /> On various other small
            matters, sufficient his temper to roil,<br /> And finely contrived to
            be making the blood of an editor boil;<br /> And so one may see that
            his feelings could hardly be said to be smooth,<br /> And he needed
            some pleasant occurrence his ruffled emotions to soothe:<br /> He had
            it; for lo! on the threshold, a slow and reliable tread,<br /> And a
            farmer invaded the sanctum, and these are the words that he said:
          </p>
          <p>
            "Good-mornin', sir, Mr. Printer; how is your body to-day?<br /> I'm
            glad you're to home; for you fellers is al'ays a runnin' away.<br />
            Your paper last week wa'n't so spicy nor sharp as the one week
            before:<br /> But I s'pose when the campaign is opened, you'll be
            whoopin' it up to<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'em more.<br />
            That feller that's printin' <i>The Smasher</i> is goin' for you
            perty smart;<br /> And our folks said this mornin' at breakfast, they
            thought he was gettin'<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the start.<br />
            But I hushed 'em right up in a minute, and said a good word for you;<br />
            I told 'em I b'lieved you was tryin' to do just as well as you knew;<br />
            And I told 'em that some one was sayin', and whoever 'twas it is so,<br />
            That you can't expect much of no one man, nor blame him for what he
            don't<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know.<br /> But, layin'
            aside <i>pleasure</i> for business, I've brought you my little boy<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim;<br /> And I thought I would see if
            you couldn't make an editor outen of him.
          </p>
          <p>
            "My family stock is increasin', while other folks' seems to run
            short.<br /> I've got a right smart of a family&mdash;it's one of the
            old-fashioned sort:<br /> There's Ichabod, Isaac, and Israel,
            a-workin' away on the farm&mdash;<br /> They do 'bout as much as one
            good boy, and make things go off like a<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charm.<br />
            There's Moses and Aaron are sly ones, and slip like a couple of
            eels;<br /> But they're tol'able steady in one thing&mdash;they
            al'ays git round to their<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meals.<br />
            There's Peter is busy inventin' (though <i>what</i> he invents I
            can't see),<br /> And Joseph is studyin' medicine&mdash;and both of
            'em boardin' with me.<br /> There's Abram and Albert is married, each
            workin' my farm for myself,<br /> And Sam smashed his nose at a
            shootin', and so he is laid on the shelf.<br /> The rest of the boys
            are all growin', 'cept this little runt, which is<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim,<br />
            And I thought that perhaps I'd be makin' an editor outen o' him.
          </p>
          <p>
            "He ain't no great shakes for to labor, though I've labored with him
            a<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good deal,<br /> And give him
            some strappin' good arguments I know he couldn't help but<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to feel;<br /> But he's built out of
            second-growth timber, and nothin' about him is big<br /> Exceptin'
            his appetite only, and there he's as good as a pig.<br /> I keep him
            a-carryin' luncheons, and fillin' and bringin' the jugs,<br /> And
            take him among the pertatoes, and set him to pickin' the bugs;<br />
            And then there is things to be doin' a-helpin' the women indoors;<br />
            There's churnin' and washin' of dishes, and other descriptions of
            chores;<br /> But he don't take to nothin' but victuals, and he'll
            never be much,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid,<br />
            So I thought it would be a good notion to larn him the editor's
            trade.<br /> His body's too small for a farmer, his judgment is
            rather too slim,<br /> But I thought we perhaps could be makin' an
            editor outen o' him!
          </p>
          <p>
            "It ain't much to get up a paper&mdash;it wouldn't take him long for
            to learn;<br /> He could feed the machine, I'm thinkin', with a good
            strappin' fellow to<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn.<br />
            And things that was once hard in doin', is easy enough now to do;<br />
            Just keep your eye on your machinery, and crack your arrangements
            right<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through.<br /> I used for to
            wonder at readin' and where it was got up, and how;<br /> But 'tis
            most of it made by machinery&mdash;I can see it all plain enough
            now.<br /> And poetry, too, is constructed by machines of different
            designs,<br /> Each one with a gauge and a chopper to see to the
            length of the lines;<br /> And I hear a New York clairvoyant is
            runnin' one sleeker than grease,<br /> And <i>a-rentin'</i> her
            heaven-born productions at a couple of dollars apiece;<br /> An'
            since the whole trade has growed easy, 'twould be easy enough, I've<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a whim,<br /> If you was agreed, to be
            makin' an editor outen of Jim!"
          </p>
          <p>
            The Editor sat in his sanctum and looked the old man in the eye,<br />
            Then glanced at the grinning young hopeful, and mournfully made his
            reply:<br /> "Is your son a small unbound edition of Moses and
            Solomon both?<br /> Can he compass his spirit with meekness, and
            strangle a natural oath?<br /> Can he leave all his wrongs to the
            future, and carry his heart in his<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheek?<br />
            Can he do an hour's work in a minute, and live on a sixpence a week?<br />
            Can he courteously talk to an equal, and browbeat an impudent dunce?<br />
            Can he keep things in apple-pie order, and do half a dozen at once?<br />
            Can he press all the springs of knowledge, with quick and reliable
            touch,<br /> And be sure that he knows how much <i>to</i> know, and
            knows how to not<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know too much?<br />
            Does he know how to spur up his virtue, and put a check-rein on his
            pride?<br /> Can he carry a gentleman's manners within a rhinoceros'

            cheerfulness, courage,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and vim?<br />
            If so, we perhaps can be makin an editor 'outen of him.'"
          </p>
          <p>
            The farmer stood curiously listening, while wonder his visage
            o'erspread;<br /> And he said, "Jim, I guess we'll be goin'; he's
            probably out of his head."
          </p>
          <p>
            But lo! on the rickety stair-case, another reliable tread,<br /> And
            entered another old farmer, and these are the words that he said:
          </p>
          <p>
            "Good-morning, sir, Mr. Editor, how is the folks to-day?<br /> I owe
            you for next year's paper; I thought I'd come in and pay.<br /> And
            Jones is agoin' to take it, and this is his money here;<br /> I shut
            down on lendin' it to him, and coaxed him to try it a year.<br /> And
            here is a few little items that happened last week in our town:<br />
            I thought they'd look good for the paper, and so I just jotted 'em
            down.<br /> And here is a basket of cherries my wife picked expressly
            for you;<br /> And a small bunch of flowers from Jennie&mdash;she
            thought she must send<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;somethin'
            too.<br /> You're doin' the politics bully, as all of our family
            agree;<br /> Just keep your old goose-quill a-floppin', and give 'em
            a good one for me.<br /> And now you are chuck full of business, and
            I won't be takin' your time;<br /> I've things of my own I must 'tend
            to&mdash;good-day, sir, I b'lieve I will<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;climb."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Editor sat in his sanctum and brought down his fist with a
            thump:<br /> "God bless that old farmer," he muttered, "he's a
            regular Editor's trump."
          </p>
          <p>
            And 'tis thus with our noble profession, and thus it will ever be,
            still;<br /> There are some who appreciate its labors, and some who
            perhaps never will.<br /> But in the great time that is coming, when
            loudly the trumpet shall sound,<br /> And they who have labored and
            rested shall come from the quivering ground;<br /> When they who have
            striven and suffered to teach and ennoble the race,<br /> Shall march
            at the front of the column, each one in his God-given place,<br /> As
            they pass through the gates of The City with proud and victorious<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tread,<br /> The editor, printer, and
            "devil," will travel not far from the head.

            I've been to the old farm-house, good-wife,<br /> Where you and I
            were wed;<br /> Where the love was born to our two hearts<br /> That
            now lies cold and dead.<br /> Where a long-kept secret to you I told,<br />
            In the yellow beams of the moon,<br /> And we forged our vows out of
            love's own gold,<br /> To be broken so soon, so soon!

          <p>
            I passed through all the old rooms, good-wife;<br /> I wandered on
            and on;<br /> I followed the steps of a flitting ghost,<br /> The
            ghost of a love that is gone.<br /> And he led me out to the arbor,
            wife,<br /> Where with myrtles I twined your hair;<br /> And he seated
            me down on the old stone step,<br /> And left me musing there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sun went down as it used to do,<br /> And sunk in the sea of
            night;<br /> The two bright stars that we called ours<br /> Came
            slowly unto my sight;<br /> But the one that was mine went under a
            cloud&mdash;<br /> Went under a cloud, alone;<br /> And a tear that I
            wouldn't have shed for the world,<br /> Fell down on the old gray

            more begun.<br /> And maybe some time in the time to come,<br /> When
            a few more years are sped,<br /> We'll love again as we used to love,<br />

          </p>
          <p>
            And she has prayed, if it might be<br /> Within the reach of human
            skill,<br /> And not averse to Heaven, that she<br /> Might live a
            little longer still.
          </p>
          <p>
            But earthly hope is gone; and now<br /> Comes in its place a brighter
            beam,<br /> Leaving upon her snowy brow<br /> The impress of a
            heavenly dream:
          </p>
          <p>
            That she, when her frail body yields,<br /> And fades away to mortal
            eyes,<br /> Shall burst through Heaven's eternal fields,<br /> And
            bloom again&mdash;in Paradise.

            The flowers that bloom in the dear old garden, the birds that sing<br />

            I!<br /> By father's grave on yonder hill&mdash;his name without a

            It is a bright and glorious day the joys of earth to grasp&mdash;<br />

            her to weave a bright, gay garland, and crown me as of yore,<br />
            Then plant a lily upon my grave, and think of me no more.<br /> And
            tell that maiden whose love I sought, that I was faithful yet;<br />
            But I must lie in a felon's grave, and she had best forget.<br /> My
            memory is stained forever; for so the Judge has said,<br /> And

            Lay me not down by my father's side; for once, I mind, he said<br />
            No child that stained his spotless name should share his mortal bed.<br />
            Old friends would look beyond his grave, to my dishonored one,<br />
            And hide the virtues of the sire behind the recreant son.<br /> And I
            can fancy, if there my corse its fettered limbs should lay,<br /> His
            frowning skull and crumbling bones would shrink from me away;<br />

            for the rest&mdash;for form or rite&mdash;but little do I reck;<br />
            But cover up that cursed stain&mdash;<i>the black mark on my neck!</i><br />
            And pray to God for his great mercy on my devoted head;<br /> For
            they'll hang me to the gallows, mother&mdash;hang me till I'm dead!
          </p>
          <p>
            But hark! I hear a mighty murmur among the jostling crowd!<br /> A
            cry!&mdash;a shout!&mdash;a roar of voices!&mdash;it echoes long and
            loud!<br /> There dashes a horseman with foaming steed and
            tightly-gathered rein!<br /> He sits erect!&mdash;he waves his hand!&mdash;good
            Heaven! 'tis Allen Bayne!<br /> The lost is found, the dead alive, my
            safety is achieved!<br /> For he waves his hand again, and shouts,
            "The prisoner is reprieved!"<br /> Now, mother, praise the God you
            love, and raise your drooping head;<br /> For the murderous gallows,
            black and grim, is cheated of its dead!

            I.<br /> The great procession came up the street,<br /> With clatter
            of hoofs and tramp of feet;<br /> There was General Jones to guide
            the van,<br /> And Corporal Jinks, his right-hand man;<br /> And each
            was riding his high horse,<br /> And each had epaulettes, of course;<br />
            And each had a sash of the bloodiest red,<br /> And each had a shako
            on his head;<br /> And each had a sword by his left side,<br /> And
            each had his mustache newly dyed;<br /> And that was the way<br /> We
            kept the day,<br /> The great, the grand, the glorious day,<br /> That

          <p>
            II.<br /> The great procession came up the street,<br /> With loud da
            capo, and brazen repeat;<br /> There was Hans, the leader, a Teuton
            born,<br /> A sharp who worried the E flat horn;<br /> And Baritone
            Jake, and Alto Mike,<br /> Who never played any thing twice alike;<br />
            And Tenor Tom, of conservative mind,<br /> Who always came out a note
            behind;<br /> And Dick, whose tuba was seldom dumb,<br /> And Bob, who
            punished the big bass drum.<br /> And when they stopped a minute to
            rest,<br /> The martial band discoursed its best;<br /> The ponderous
            drum and the pointed fife<br /> Proceeded to roll and shriek for
            life;<br /> And Bonaparte Crossed the Rhine, anon,<br /> And The Girl
            I Left Behind Me came on;<br /> And that was the way<br /> The bands
            did play<br /> On the loud, high-toned, harmonious day,<br /> That
            gave us&mdash;<br /> <i>Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</i><br /> (With some
            music of bullets, our sires would say,)<br /> Our glorious
            Independence!
          </p>
          <p>
            III.<br /> The great procession came up the street,<br /> With a wagon
            of virgins, sour and sweet;<br /> Each bearing the bloom of recent
            date,<br /> Each misrepresenting a single State.<br /> There was
            California, pious and prim,<br /> And Louisiana, humming a hymn;<br />
            The Texas lass was the smallest one&mdash;<br /> Rhode Island weighed
            the tenth of a ton;<br /> The Empire State was pure as a pearl,<br />
            And Massachusetts a modest girl;<br /> Vermont was red as the blush
            of a rose&mdash;<br /> And the goddess sported a turn-up nose;<br />
            And looked, free sylph, where she painfully sat,<br /> The worlds she
            would give to be out of that.<br /> And in this way<br /> The maidens
            gay<br /> Flashed up the street on the beautiful day,<br /> That gave
            us&mdash;<br /> <i>Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</i><br /> (With some
            sacrifices, our mothers would say,)<br /> Our glorious Independence!
          </p>
          <p>
            IV.<br /> The great procession came up the street,<br /> With firemen
            uniformed flashily neat;<br /> There was Tubbs, the foreman, with
            voice like five,<br /> The happiest, proudest man alive;<br /> With a
            trumpet half as long as a gun,<br /> Which he used for the glory of
            "Number 1;"<br /> There was Nubbs, who had climbed a ladder high,<br />
            And saved a dog that was left to die;<br /> There was Cubbs, who had
            dressed in black and blue<br /> The eye of the foreman of Number 2.<br />
            And each marched on with steady stride,<br /> And each had a look of
            fiery pride;<br /> And each glanced slyly round, with a whim<br />
            That all of the girls were looking at him;<br /> And that was the
            way,<br /> With grand display,<br /> They marched through the blaze of
            the glowing day,<br /> That gave us&mdash;<br /> <i>Hurray! Hurray!
            Hurray!</i><br /> (With some hot fighting, our fathers would say,)<br />
            Our glorious Independence!
          </p>
          <p>
            V.<br /> The eager orator took the stand,<br /> In the cause of our
            great and happy land;<br /> He aired his own political views,<br /> He
            told us all of the latest news:<br /> How the Boston folks one night
            took tea&mdash;<br /> Their grounds for steeping it in the sea;<br />
            What a heap of Britons our fathers did kill,<br /> At the little
            skirmish of Bunker Hill;<br /> He put us all in anxious doubt<br /> As
            to how that matter was coming out;<br /> And when at last he had
            fought us through<br /> To the bloodless year of '82,<br /> 'Twas the
            fervent hope of every one<br /> That he, as well as the war, was
            done.<br /> But he continued to painfully soar<br /> For something
            less than a century more;<br /> Until at last he had fairly begun<br />
            The wars of eighteen-sixty-one;<br /> And never rested till 'neath
            the tree<br /> That shadowed the glory of Robert Lee.<br /> And then
            he inquired, with martial frown,<br /> "Americans, must we go down?"<br />
            And as an answer from Heaven were sent,<br /> The stand gave way, and
            down he went.<br /> A singer or two beneath him did drop&mdash;<br />
            A big fat alderman fell atop;<br /> And that was the way<br /> Our
            orator lay,<br /> Till we fished him out, on the eloquent day,<br />
            That gave us&mdash;<br /> <i>Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</i><br /> (With a
            clash of arms, Pat. Henry would say,)<br /> Our wordy Independence!
          </p>
          <p>
            VI.<br /> The marshal his hungry compatriots led,<br /> Where
            Freedom's viands were thickly spread,<br /> With all that man or
            woman could eat,<br /> From crisp to sticky&mdash;from sour to sweet.<br />
            There were chickens that scarce had learned to crow,<br /> And
            veteran roosters of long ago;<br /> There was one old turkey, huge
            and fierce,<br /> That was hatched in the days of President Pierce;<br />
            Of which, at last, with an ominous groan,<br /> The parson essayed to
            swallow a bone;<br /> And it took three sinners, plucky and stout,<br />
            To grapple the evil and bring it out.<br /> And still the dinner went
            merrily on,<br /> And James and Lucy and Hannah and John<br /> Kept
            winking their eyes and smacking their lips,<br /> And passing the
            eatables into eclipse.<br /> And that was the way<br /> The grand
            array<br /> Of victuals vanished on that day,<br /> That gave us&mdash;<br />
            <i>Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</i><br /> (With some starvation, the
            records say,)<br /> Our well-fed Independence!
          </p>
          <p>
            VII.<br /> The people went home through the sultry night,<br /> In a
            murky mood and a pitiful plight;<br /> Not more had the rockets'
            sticks gone down,<br /> Than the spirits of them who had "been to
            town;"<br /> Not more did the fire-balloon collapse,<br /> Than the
            pride of them who had known mishaps.<br /> There were feathers
            ruffled, and tempers roiled,<br /> And several brand-new dresses
            spoiled;<br /> There were hearts that ached from envy's thorns,<br />
            And feet that twinged with trampled corns;<br /> There were joys
            proved empty, through and through,<br /> And several purses empty,
            too;<br /> And some reeled homeward, muddled and late,<br /> Who
            hadn't taken their glory straight;<br /> And some were fated to
            lodge, that night,<br /> In the city lock-up, snug and tight;<br />
            And that was the way<br /> The deuce was to pay,<br /> As it always
            is, at the close of the day,<br /> That gave us&mdash;<br /> <i>Hurray!
            Hurray! Hurray!</i><br /> (With some restrictions, the fault-finders
            say,)<br /> That which, please God, we will keep for aye&mdash;<br />

Produced by David Widger

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
